### ðŸ’¡ Our Philosophy (The Why)

Why build another weather app? Because for us, planning an outdoor activity is about more than just knowing "will it rain?".

For a landscape photographer, it's about chasing the *golden hour*, humidity levels, and visibility. For an astrophotographer, it's about the moon phase, light pollution, and air quality.

We found that users had to switch between 3-4 different apps (weather, astronomy, air pollution) just to plan a single activity. This process is fragmented, confusing, and inefficient.

### ðŸŽ¯ Our Solution (The What)

**TitikKondisi** (Condition Point) is our answer.

It's an integrated platform that combines weather data with critical environmental parametersâ€”air quality, light pollution, moon phases, and moreâ€”all in one application.

We don't just present raw data. We process it into simple, actionable recommendations, personalized for your specific activity, whether it's hiking, photography, or just stargazing. Our target audience includes hobbyists, students, athletes, and photographers who need relevant, individualized data.

Our goal is to make your planning **faster, more precise, and more effective**.

### âœ¨ Key Features

* **Integrated Data:** Get Weather, Air Quality (AQI), UV Index, Moon Phase, and Light Pollution data in one intuitive interface.
* **Smart Recommendations:** Get instant scores like an "Observation Score" for stargazing or the "Best Time" for astronomical activities.
* **Deep Personalization:** We provide "Passion Tabs" that give you highly relevant data for your specific hobby, such as astrophotography or landscape photography.
* **Pro-Active Notifications:** Our notifications don't just warn you about rain, but also about the perfect conditions for photography or a clear night for astronomy.
